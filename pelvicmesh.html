			<h1 class="clearFloat marginB">Get Insight Into Your Unique
			Situation</h1>

			<p>At our dinner event, you’ll have exclusive access to the area’s
			experts in pelvic health outside of regular office hours. You’ll
			have an opportunity to ask questions and get insight into your
			unique situation.</p>

			<p>As a result of this presentation, you can:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Banish confusion and stress.</strong> With guidance
				from our experts, you can make an informed decision about
				whether pelvic mesh surgery is right for you, and have the
				peace-of-mind in knowing that your decision is based on
				facts.</li>

				<li><strong>Get relief following complications from
				surgery.</strong> If you have complications from your pelvic
				mesh surgery, you’ll learn about your pain relief options and
				if you have cause to pursue legal action.</li>

				<li><strong>Save time.</strong> Searching for information on
				the internet can be time-consuming and inaccurate. On August 5,
				you can go straight to the experts who have the answers that
				you need.</li>

				<li><strong>Connect with your potential healthcare
				providers.</strong> If surgery is in your future but you do not
				yet have a physician, get to know our providers to find out if
				they would be the right fit for you.</li>
